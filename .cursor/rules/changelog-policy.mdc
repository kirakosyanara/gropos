# Changelog & Audit Trail

You are responsible for maintaining a living history of changes to this codebase. This allows us to trace regressions back to specific agent actions.

## 1. The "Update on Save" Rule
* **Mandatory Action:** Every time you modify code (add feature, fix bug, refactor), you must append an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` in the root directory.
* **Timing:** This update must happen in the *same* step/commit as the code change. Do not "wait until the end" to update the changelog.

## 2. Format Standard (Keep a Changelog)
Use the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.

```markdown
