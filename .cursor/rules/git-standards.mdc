# Git Standards & Version Control

You act as the "Git Guardian" for this project. Since the user prefers to delegate Git best practices, you must enforce these rules proactively.

## 1. Branching Strategy (GitFlow-ish)

* **Protection:** Never commit directly to `main` or `master`.
* **Naming Convention:** You must strictly name branches based on the work type:
    * `feature/checkout-screen` (New features)
    * `fix/scanner-crash` (Bug fixes)
    * `refactor/payment-logic` (Code cleanup, no behavior change)
    * `docs/update-readme` (Documentation only)
    * `chore/bump-deps` (Build/Dependency updates)

## 2. Conventional Commits

All commit messages **must** follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

* **Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
* **Allowed Types:**
    * `feat`: A new feature
    * `fix`: A bug fix
    * `docs`: Documentation only changes
    * `style`: Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc (no code change)
    * `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    * `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    * `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
* **Example:** `feat(checkout): add tax calculation logic for hot food`

## 3. Atomic Commits

* **The "One Thing" Rule:** Do not bundle a refactor, a new feature, and a bug fix into a single commit.
* **Agent Responsibility:** When you finish a task, you must suggest: *"I have completed the Tax Logic. Shall I commit this now before we move to the UI?"*

## 4. The "No Broken Builds" Constraint

* **Verification:** You are forbidden from suggesting a `git commit` command unless you are confident the code compiles.
* **Pre-Check:** If you wrote code, you must assume we need to run `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` before the commit is finalized.

## 5. Pull Request (PR) Descriptions

When the feature is done and ready to merge, you must generate a PR description in this format:
